In the context of the Cosmos SDK, an Invariant is a function that checks for a particular invariant. These functions are useful to detect bugs early on and act upon them to limit their potential consequences (e.g. by halting the chain). They are also useful in the development process of the application to detect bugs via simulations.","sidebar":"buildSidebar"},"docs/build/building-modules/keeper":{"id":"docs/build/building-modules/keeper","title":"Keepers","description":"Keepers refer to a Cosmos SDK abstraction whose role is to manage access to the subset of the state defined by various modules. Keepers are module-specific, i.e. the subset of state defined by a module can only be accessed by a keeper defined in said module. If a module needs to access the subset of state defined by another module, a reference to the second module\'s internal keeper needs to be passed to the first one. This is done by specifying the module inputs in the depinject config; runtime will ensure that the correct keeper is passed to the module.","sidebar":"buildSidebar"},"docs/build/building-modules/messages-and-queries":{"id":"docs/build/building-modules/messages-and-queries","title":"Messages and Queries","description":"Msgs and Queries are the two primary objects handled by modules.
